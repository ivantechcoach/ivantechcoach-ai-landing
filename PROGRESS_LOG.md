## ‚úÖ Completed Activities (Stage 1)

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Created repo `ivantechcoach-ai-landing` on GitHub.
   - Fixed remote confusion (previous `landing-page` repo removed).
   - Connected local project folder to correct remote.

2. **Base Structure**
   - Added `index.html` with accessible structure (hero, services, contact).
   - Added `assets/css/style.css` with base theme and responsive grid.
   - Added `assets/js/main.js` with ARIA-friendly navbar toggle.
   - Created `assets/images/` for logo and profile placeholders.

3. **Documentation**
   - Added professional `README.md` with project details and live demo link.
   - Added `COMMIT_GUIDE.md` with commit standards.
   - Added `.gitignore` to exclude OS junk, env, and cache files.

4. **Version Control Practices**
   - First commits structured using `feat`, `docs`, `assets` types.
   - Understood Git errors: fixed `non-fast-forward` issue via merge.
   - Learned how to resolve **asset path case-sensitivity** for GitHub Pages.

5. **Deployment**
   - Activated GitHub Pages from `main / root`.
   - Landing published successfully:

## üí° Key Learnings
- **GitHub Pages is case-sensitive**: folder names (`images` vs `img`, `style.css` vs `styles.css`) must match exactly.  
- **Non-fast-forward errors**: solved by pulling remote history or forcing push.  
- **Commit discipline**: short summary + extended description helps keep history professional.  
- **Documentation matters**: having `README`, `COMMIT_GUIDE`, and this log improves clarity and personal branding.

---

## üìç Next Steps (Stage 2 Roadmap)
- Enhance **UI/UX**: improve hero section, typography, and responsive behavior.
- Add **AI placeholder section** (for future API integrations).
- Optimize **images** and add branding assets (final logo, favicon).
- Write a **blog/LinkedIn post** explaining Stage 1 as a case study.
- Connect **custom domain** (`ivantechcoach.es`) to GitHub Pages.
